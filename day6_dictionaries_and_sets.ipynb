    "## 6 D I C T I O N A R I E S \n",
    "In this chapter you’ll learn how to use Python’s dictionaries, which allow you to con-nect pieces of related information. You’ll learn how to access the information once it’s in a dic-tionary and how to modify that information. Because dictionaries can store an almost limitless amount of  information, I’ll show you how to loop through the data in a dictionary. Additionally, you’ll learn to nest dictionaries inside lists, lists inside diction-aries, and even dictionaries inside other dictionaries.Understanding dictionaries allows you to model a variety of real-world objects more accurately. You’ll be able to create a dictionary representing a person and then store as much information as you want about that person. You can store their name, age, location, profession, and any other aspect of a person you can describe. You’ll be able to store any two kinds of informa-tion that can be matched up, such as a list of words and their meanings, a list of people’s names and their favorite numbers, a list of mountains and their elevations, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Simple Dictionary\n",
    "Consider a game featuring aliens that can have different colors and point values. This simple dictionary stores information about a particular alien:\n",
    "alien.py alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}print(alien_0['color'])print(alien_0['points'])\n",
    "The dictionary alien_0 stores the alien’s color and point value. The last two lines access and display that information, as shown here:\n",
    "green5\n",
    "As with most new programming concepts, using dictionaries takes prac-tice. Once you’ve worked with dictionaries for a bit, you’ll see how effectively they can model real-world situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with Dictionaries\n",
    "A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. A key’s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. In fact, you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary.In Python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces ({}) with a series of key-value pairs inside the braces, as shown in the earlier example:\n",
    "alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n",
    "A key-value pair is a set of values associated with each other. When you provide a key, Python returns the value associated with that key. Every key is connected to its value by a colon, and individual key-value pairs are separated by commas. You can store as many key-value pairs as you want in a dictionary.The simplest dictionary has exactly one key-value pair, as shown in this modified version of the alien_0 dictionary:\n",
    "alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}\n",
    "This dictionary stores one piece of information about alien_0: the alien’s color. The string 'color' is a key in this dictionary, and its associated value is 'green'.\n",
    "Accessing Values in a Dictionary\n",
    "To get the value associated with a key, give the name of the dictionary and then place the key inside a set of square brackets, as shown here:\n",
    "alien.py alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}print(alien_0['color'])\n",
    "Dictionaries   93\n",
    "This returns the value associated with the key 'color' from the diction-ary alien_0:\n",
    "green\n",
    "You can have an unlimited number of key-value pairs in a dictionary. For example, here’s the original alien_0 dictionary with two key-value pairs:\n",
    "alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n",
    "Now you can access either the color or the point value of alien_0. If a player shoots down this alien, you can look up how many points they should earn using code like this:\n",
    "alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}new_points = alien_0['points']print(f\"You just earned {new_points} points!\")\n",
    "Once the dictionary has been defined, we pull the value associated with the key 'points' from the dictionary. This value is then assigned to the vari-able new_points. The last line prints a statement about how many points the player just earned:\n",
    "You just earned 5 points!\n",
    "If you run this code every time an alien is shot down, the alien’s point value will be retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding New Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "Dictionaries are dynamic structures, and you can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary at any time. To add a new key-value pair, you would give the name of the dictionary followed by the new key in square brackets, along with the new value.Let’s add two new pieces of information to the alien_0 dictionary: the alien’s x- and y-coordinates, which will help us display the alien at a par-ticular position on the screen. Let’s place the alien on the left edge of the screen, 25 pixels down from the top. Because screen coordinates usually start at the upper-left corner of the screen, we’ll place the alien on the left edge of the screen by setting the x-coordinate to 0 and 25 pixels from the top by setting its y-coordinate to positive 25, as shown here:\n",
    "alien.py alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}print(alien_0)alien_0['x_position'] = 0alien_0['y_position'] = 25print(alien_0)\n",
    "94   Chapter 6\n",
    "We start by defining the same dictionary that we’ve been working with. We then print this dictionary, displaying a snapshot of its information. Next, we add a new key-value pair to the dictionary: the key 'x_position' and the value 0. We do the same for the key 'y_position'. When we print the modified dictionary, we see the two additional key-value pairs:\n",
    "{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'x_position': 0, 'y_position': 25}\n",
    "The final version of the dictionary contains four key-value pairs. The original two specify color and point value, and two more specify the alien’s position.Dictionaries retain the order in which they were defined. When you print a dictionary or loop through its elements, you will see the elements in the same order they were added to the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with an Empty Dictionary\n",
    "It’s sometimes convenient, or even necessary, to start with an empty diction-ary and then add each new item to it. To start filling an empty dictionary, define a dictionary with an empty set of braces and then add each key-value pair on its own line. For example, here’s how to build the alien_0 dictionary using this approach:\n",
    "alien.py alien_0 = {}alien_0['color'] = 'green'alien_0['points'] = 5print(alien_0)\n",
    "We first define an empty alien_0 dictionary, and then add color and point values to it. The result is the dictionary we’ve been using in previous examples:\n",
    "{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}\n",
    "Typically, you’ll use empty dictionaries when storing user-supplied data in a dictionary or when writing code that generates a large number of key-value pairs automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modifying Values in a Dictionary\n",
    "To modify a value in a dictionary, give the name of the dictionary with the key in square brackets and then the new value you want associated with  that key. For example, consider an alien that changes from green to yellow as a game progresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}\n",
    "print(f\"The alien is {alien_0['color']}.\")\n",
    "alien_0['color'] = 'yellow'\n",
    "print(f\"The alien is now {alien_0['color']}.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "We first define a dictionary for alien_0 that contains only the alien’s color; then we change the value associated with the key 'color' to 'yellow'. The output shows that the alien has indeed changed from green to yellow:\n",
    "The alien is green.The alien is now yellow.\n",
    "For a more interesting example, let’s track the position of an alien that can move at different speeds. We’ll store a value representing the alien’s current speed and then use it to determine how far to the right the alien should move:\n",
    "alien_0 = {'x_position': 0, 'y_position': 25, 'speed': 'medium'}print(f\"Original position: {alien_0['x_position']}\")# Move the alien to the right.# Determine how far to move the alien based on its current speed.\n",
    "1 if alien_0['speed'] == 'slow':    x_increment = 1elif alien_0['speed'] == 'medium':    x_increment = 2else:    # This must be a fast alien.    x_increment = 3# The new position is the old position plus the increment.\n",
    "2 alien_0['x_position'] = alien_0['x_position'] + x_incrementprint(f\"New position: {alien_0['x_position']}\")\n",
    "We start by defining an alien with an initial x position and y position, and a speed of 'medium'. We’ve omitted the color and point values for the sake of simplicity, but this example would work the same way if you included those key-value pairs as well. We also print the original value of x_position to see how far the alien moves to the right.An if-elif-else chain determines how far the alien should move to the right, and assigns this value to the variable x_increment 1. If the alien’s speed is 'slow', it moves one unit to the right; if the speed is 'medium', it moves two units to the right; and if it’s 'fast', it moves three units to the right. Once the increment has been calculated, it’s added to the value of \n",
    "x_position 2, and the result is stored in the dictionary’s x_position.Because this is a medium-speed alien, its position shifts two units to the right:\n",
    "Original x-position: 0New x-position: 2\n",
    "96   Chapter 6\n",
    "This technique is pretty cool: by changing one value in the alien’s dic-tionary, you can change the overall behavior of the alien. For example, to turn this medium-speed alien into a fast alien, you would add this line:\n",
    "alien_0['speed'] = 'fast'\n",
    "The if-elif-else block would then assign a larger value to x_increment the next time the code runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "When you no longer need a piece of information that’s stored in a diction-ary, you can use the del statement to completely remove a key-value pair. All del needs is the name of the dictionary and the key that you want to remove.For example, let’s remove the key 'points' from the alien_0 dictionary, along with its value:\n",
    "alien.py alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}print(alien_0)\n",
    "1 del alien_0['points']print(alien_0)\n",
    "The del statement 1 tells Python to delete the key 'points' from the dictionary alien_0 and to remove the value associated with that key as well. The output shows that the key 'points' and its value of 5 are deleted from the dictionary, but the rest of the dictionary is unaffected:\n",
    "{'color': 'green', 'points': 5}{'color': 'green'}\n",
    "N O T E  Be aware that the deleted key-value pair is removed permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dictionary of Similar Objects\n",
    "The previous example involved storing different kinds of information about one object, an alien in a game. You can also use a dictionary to store one kind of information about many objects. For example, say you want to poll a number of people and ask them what their favorite programming language is. A dictionary is useful for storing the results of a simple poll, like this:\n",
    "favorite _languages.py\n",
    "favorite_languages = {    'jen': 'python',    'sarah': 'c',    'edward': 'rust',    'phil': 'python',    }\n",
    "Dictionaries   97\n",
    "As you can see, we’ve broken a larger dictionary into several lines. Each key is the name of a person who responded to the poll, and each value is their language choice. When you know you’ll need more than one line to define a dictionary, press ENTER after the opening brace. Then indent the next line one level (four spaces) and write the first key-value pair, followed by a comma. From this point forward when you press ENTER, your text edi-tor should automatically indent all subsequent key-value pairs to match the first key-value pair.Once you’ve finished defining the dictionary, add a closing brace on a new line after the last key-value pair, and indent it one level so it aligns with the keys in the dictionary. It’s good practice to include a comma after the last key-value pair as well, so you’re ready to add a new key-value pair on the next line.\n",
    "N O T E  Most editors have some functionality that helps you format extended lists and dic-tionaries in a similar manner to this example. Other acceptable ways to format long dictionaries are available as well, so you may see slightly different formatting in your editor, or in other sources.\n",
    "To use this dictionary, given the name of a person who took the poll, you can easily look up their favorite language:\n",
    "favorite _languages.py\n",
    "favorite_languages = {    'jen': 'python',    'sarah': 'c',    'edward': 'rust',    'phil': 'python',    }\n",
    "1 language = favorite_languages['sarah'].title()print(f\"Sarah's favorite language is {language}.\")\n",
    "To see which language Sarah chose, we ask for the value at:\n",
    "favorite_languages['sarah']\n",
    "We use this syntax to pull Sarah’s favorite language from the dictionary 1 and assign it to the variable language. Creating a new variable here makes for a much cleaner print() call. The output shows Sarah’s favorite language:\n",
    "Sarah's favorite language is C.\n",
    "You could use this same syntax with any individual represented in the dictionary.\n",
    "Using get() to Access Values\n",
    "Using keys in square brackets to retrieve the value you’re interested in\n",
    "\n",
    "Using get() to Access Values\n",
    "Using keys in square brackets to retrieve the value you’re interested in from a dictionary might cause one potential problem: if the key you ask for doesn’t exist, you’ll get an error.\n",
    "98   Chapter 6\n",
    "Let’s see what happens when you ask for the point value of an alien that doesn’t have a point value set:\n",
    "alien_no _points.py\n",
    "alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'speed': 'slow'}print(alien_0['points'])\n",
    "This results in a traceback, showing a KeyError:\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):  File \"alien_no_points.py\", line 2, in <module>    print(alien_0['points'])          ~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^KeyError: 'points'\n",
    "You’ll learn more about how to handle errors like this in general in Chapter 10. For dictionaries specifically, you can use the get() method to set  a default value that will be returned if the requested key doesn’t exist.The get() method requires a key as a first argument. As a second optional argument, you can pass the value to be returned if the key doesn’t exist:\n",
    "alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'speed': 'slow'}point_value = alien_0.get('points', 'No point value assigned.')print(point_value)\n",
    "If the key 'points' exists in the dictionary, you’ll get the correspond-ing value. If it doesn’t, you get the default value. In this case, points doesn’t exist, and we get a clean message instead of an error:\n",
    "No point value assigned.\n",
    "If there’s a chance the key you’re asking for might not exist, consider using the get() method instead of the square bracket notation.\n",
    "N O T E  If you leave out the second argument in the call to get() and the key doesn’t exist, Python will return the value None. The special value None means “no value exists.” This is not an error: it’s a special value meant to indicate the absence of a value. You’ll see more uses for None in Chapter 8.\n",

    "Looping Through a Dictionary\n",
    "A single Python dictionary can contain just a few key-value pairs or millions of pairs. Because a dictionary can contain large amounts of data, Python lets you loop through a dictionary. Dictionaries can be used to store infor-mation in a variety of ways; therefore, several different ways exist to loop through them. You can loop through all of a dictionary’s key-value pairs, through its keys, or through its values.\n",
    "Looping Through All Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "Before we explore the different approaches to looping, let’s consider a new dictionary designed to store information about a user on a website. The  following dictionary would store one person’s username, first name, and last name:\n",
    "user.py user_0 = {    'username': 'efermi',    'first': 'enrico',    'last': 'fermi',    }\n",
    "You can access any single piece of information about user_0 based on what you’ve already learned in this chapter. But what if you wanted to see everything stored in this user’s dictionary? To do so, you could loop through the dictionary using a for loop:\n",

    "100   Chapter 6\n",
    "for key, value in user_0.items():    print(f\"\\nKey: {key}\")    print(f\"Value: {value}\")\n",
    "To write a for loop for a dictionary, you create names for the two vari-ables that will hold the key and value in each key-value pair. You can choose any names you want for these two variables. This code would work just as well if you had used abbreviations for the variable names, like this:\n",
    "for k, v in user_0.items()\n",
    "The second half of the for statement includes the name of the dictionary followed by the method items(), which returns a sequence of key-value pairs. The for loop then assigns each of these pairs to the two variables provided. In the preceding example, we use the variables to print each key, followed by the associated value. The \"\\n\" in the first print() call ensures that a blank line is inserted before each key-value pair in the output:\n",
    "Key: usernameValue: efermiKey: firstValue: enricoKey: lastValue: fermi\n",
    "Looping through all key-value pairs works particularly well for diction-aries like the favorite_languages.py example on page 96, which stores the same kind of information for many different keys. If you loop through the \n",
    "favorite_languages dictionary, you get the name of each person in the dic-tionary and their favorite programming language. Because the keys always refer to a person’s name and the value is always a language, we’ll use the variables name and language in the loop instead of key and value. This will make it easier to follow what’s happening inside the loop:\n",

If you were to use only a list, all you could really store is a list of the pizza’s toppings. With a dictionary, a list of top-pings can be just one aspect of the pizza you’re describing.In the following example, two kinds of information are stored for each pizza: a type of crust and a list of toppings. The list of toppings is a value associated with the key 'toppings'. To use the items in the list, we give the name of the dictionary and the key 'toppings', as we would any value in the dictionary. Instead of returning a single value, we get a list of toppings:\n",

    "We begin with a dictionary that holds information about a pizza that has been ordered. One key in the dictionary is 'crust', and the associated value is the string 'thick'. The next key, 'toppings', has a list as its value that stores all requested toppings. We summarize the order before building the pizza 1. When you need to break up a long line in a print() call, choose an appropriate point at which to break the line being printed, and end the line with a quotation mark. Indent the next line, add an opening quotation mark, and continue the string. Python will automatically combine all of the strings it finds inside the parentheses. To print the toppings, we write a for loop 2. To access the list of toppings, we use the key 'toppings', and Python grabs the list of toppings from the dictionary.The following output summarizes the pizza that we plan to build:\n",
    "You ordered a thick-crust pizza with the following toppings:    mushrooms    extra cheese\n",
    "You can nest a list inside a dictionary anytime you want more than one value to be associated with a single key in a dictionary.

    "To refine this program even further, you could include an if statement at the beginning of the dictionary’s for loop to see whether each person has more than one favorite language by examining the value of len(languages). If a person has more than one favorite, the output would stay the same. If the person has only one favorite language, you could change the wording to reflect that.

    "This chapter presents another built-in type called a dictionary. Dictionaries are one of\n",
    "Python’s best features; they are the building blocks of many efficient and elegant algorithms.\n",
    "11.1 A dictionary is a mapping\n",
    "A dictionary is like a list, but more general. In a list, the indices have to be integers; in a\n",
    "dictionary they can be (almost) any type.\n",
    "A dictionary contains a collection of indices, which are called keys, and a collection of\n",
    "values. Each key is associated with a single value. The association of a key and a value is\n",
    "called a key-value pair or sometimes an item.\n",
    "In mathematical language, a dictionary represents a mapping from keys to values, so you\n",
    "can also say that each key “maps to” a value. As an example, we’ll build a dictionary that\n",
    "maps from English to Spanish words, so the keys and the values are all strings.\n",
    "The function dict creates a new dictionary with no items. Because dict is the name of a\n",
    "built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.\n",
    ">>> eng2sp = dict()\n",
    ">>> eng2sp\n",
    "{}\n",
    "The squiggly-brackets, {}, represent an empty dictionary. To add items to the dictionary,\n",
    "you can use square brackets:\n",
    ">>> eng2sp['one'] = 'uno'\n",
    "This line creates an item that maps from the key 'one' to the value 'uno'. If we print the\n",
    "dictionary again, we see a key-value pair with a colon between the key and value:\n",
    ">>> eng2sp\n",
    "{'one': 'uno'}\n",
    "This output format is also an input format. For example, you can create a new dictionary\n",
    "with three items:\n",
    "104 Chapter 11. Dictionaries\n",
    ">>> eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'}\n",
    "But if you print eng2sp, you might be surprised:\n",
    ">>> eng2sp\n",
    "{'one': 'uno', 'three': 'tres', 'two': 'dos'}\n",
    "The order of the key-value pairs might not be the same. If you type the same example\n",
    "on your computer, you might get a different result. In general, the order of items in a\n",
    "dictionary is unpredictable.\n",
    "But that’s not a problem because the elements of a dictionary are never indexed with integer indices. Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:\n",
    ">>> eng2sp['two']\n",
    "'dos'\n",
    "The key 'two' always maps to the value 'dos' so the order of the items doesn’t matter.\n",
    "If the key isn’t in the dictionary, you get an exception:\n",
    ">>> eng2sp['four']\n",
    "KeyError: 'four'\n",
    "The len function works on dictionaries; it returns the number of key-value pairs:\n",

    "True\n",
    ">>> 'uno' in eng2sp\n",

    "The in operator uses different algorithms for lists and dictionaries. For lists, it searches the\n",

    "longer in direct proportion.\n",
    "For dictionaries, Python uses an algorithm called a hashtable that has a remarkable property: the in operator takes about the same amount of time no matter how many items are\n",

    "1. You could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet. Then you could traverse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding counter, probably using a chained conditional.\n",
    "2. You could create a list with 26 elements. Then you could convert each character to\n",
    "a number (using the built-in function ord), use the number as an index into the list,\n",
    "and increment the appropriate counter.\n",
    "3. You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the corresponding values. The first time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary.\n",
    "After that you would increment the value of an existing item.\n",
    "Each of these options performs the same computation, but each of them implements that\n",
    "computation in a different way.\n",
    "An implementation is a way of performing a computation; some implementations are\n",
    "better than others. For example, an advantage of the dictionary implementation is that we\n",

    "{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'o': 2, 'n': 1, 's': 2, 'r': 2, 'u': 2, 't': 1}\n",
    "The histogram indicates that the letters 'a' and 'b' appear once; 'o' appears twice, and\n",
    "so on.\n",
    "Dictionaries have a method called get that takes a key and a default value. If the key\n",
    "appears in the dictionary, get returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the\n",
    "default value. For example:\n",
    ">>> h = histogram('a')\n",

    "It is common to use global variables for flags; that is, boolean variables that indicate (“flag”)\n",

    "been_called = True # WRONG\n",
    "But if you run it you will see that the value of been_called doesn’t change. The problem\n",
    "is that example2 creates a new local variable named been_called. The local variable goes\n",
    "away when the function ends, and has no effect on the global variable.\n",
    "To reassign a global variable inside a function you have to declare the global variable before\n",

    "been_called = False\n",
    "def example2():\n",

    "11.8 Debugging\n",
    "As you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to debug by printing and checking the output by hand. Here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:\n",
    "Scale down the input: If possible, reduce the size of the dataset. For example if the program reads a text file, start with just the first 10 lines, or with the smallest example\n",
    "you can find. You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the program\n",
    "so it reads only the first n lines.\n",
    "If there is an error, you can reduce n to the smallest value that manifests the error, and\n",
    "then increase it gradually as you find and correct errors.\n",
    "Check summaries and types: Instead of printing and checking the entire dataset, consider\n",
    "printing summaries of the data: for example, the number of items in a dictionary or\n",
    "the total of a list of numbers.\n",
    "A common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right type. For debugging\n",
    "this kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.\n",
    "Write self-checks: Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically. For\n",
    "example, if you are computing the average of a list of numbers, you could check that\n",
    "the result is not greater than the largest element in the list or less than the smallest.\n",
    "This is called a “sanity check” because it detects results that are “insane”.\n",
    "Another kind of check compares the results of two different computations to see if\n",
    "they are consistent. This is called a “consistency check”.\n",
    "112 Chapter 11. Dictionaries\n",
    "Format the output: Formatting debugging output can make it easier to spot an error. We\n",
    "saw an example in Section 6.9. Another tool you might find useful is the pprint module, which provides a pprint function that displays built-in types in a more humanreadable format (pprint stands for “pretty print”).\n",
