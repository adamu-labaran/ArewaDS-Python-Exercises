    "?_What are Exceptions?_\n",
    "\n",
    ">Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program's execution. They occur when something unexpected happens, like trying to divide by zero, accessing a file that doesn't exist, or encountering incorrect data.  Without proper handling, exceptions can cause your program to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    ">_Why Handle Exceptions?_\n",
    "\n",
    ">Prevent crashes: Exception handling allows your program to gracefully deal with errors instead of abruptly terminating.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Maintain program flow: You can provide alternative code paths to execute when an exception occurs, allowing the program to continue running.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Improve user experience: Instead of showing cryptic error messages, you can provide informative and user-friendly messages.\n",
    "\n",
    ">_Debugging:_ Exception handling can help pinpoint the source of errors, making debugging easier.\n",
    "\n",
    ">_The try...except Block_\n",

    "\n",
    ">4. Encapsulation and Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Exceptions can help maintain encapsulation.  By raising exceptions when a class's internal state would be violated (like a negative balance in the BankAccount example), you prevent external code from directly manipulating the object in an invalid way.  The object itself controls its state and throws exceptions when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    ">5. Inheritance and Exceptions:\n",

    "Exceptions\n",
    "Python uses special objects called exceptions to manage errors that arise dur-ing a program’s execution. Whenever an error occurs that makes Python unsure of what to do next, it creates an exception object. If you write code that handles the exception, the program will continue running. If you don’t handle the exception, the program will halt and show a traceback, which includes a report of the exception that was raised.Exceptions are handled with try-except blocks. A try-except block asks Python to do something, but it also tells Python what to do if an excep-tion is raised. When you use try-except blocks, your programs will continue running even if things start to go wrong. Instead of tracebacks, which can be confusing for users to read, users will see friendly error messages that you’ve written.\n",
    "Handling the ZeroDivisionError Exception\n",
    "Let’s look at a simple error that causes Python to raise an exception. You probably know that it’s impossible to divide a number by zero, but let’s ask Python to do it anyway:\n",
    "division _calculator.py\n",
    "print(5/0)\n",
    "Python can’t do this, so we get a traceback:\n",

    "1 ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "The error reported in the traceback, ZeroDivisionError, is an exception object 1. Python creates this kind of object in response to a situation where it can’t do what we ask it to. When this happens, Python stops the program and tells us the kind of exception that was raised. We can use this informa-tion to modify our program. We’ll tell Python what to do when this kind of exception occurs; that way, if it happens again, we’ll be prepared.\n",
    "Files and Exceptions   193\n",
    "Using try-except Blocks\n",
    "When you think an error may occur, you can write a try-except block to handle the exception that might be raised. You tell Python to try running some code, and you tell it what to do if the code results in a particular kind of exception.Here’s what a try-except block for handling the ZeroDivisionError excep-tion looks like:\n",
    "try:    print(5/0)except ZeroDivisionError:    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n",
    "We put print(5/0), the line that caused the error, inside a try block. If the code in a try block works, Python skips over the except block. If the code in the try block causes an error, Python looks for an except block whose error matches the one that was raised, and runs the code in that block.In this example, the code in the try block produces a ZeroDivisionError, so Python looks for an except block telling it how to respond. Python then runs the code in that block, and the user sees a friendly error message instead of a traceback:\n",
    "You can't divide by zero!\n",
    "If more code followed the try-except block, the program would continue running because we told Python how to handle the error. Let’s look at an example where catching an error can allow a program to continue running.\n",
    "Using Exceptions to Prevent Crashes\n",
    "Handling errors correctly is especially important when the program has more work to do after the error occurs. This happens often in programs that prompt users for input. If the program responds to invalid input appro-priately, it can prompt for more valid input instead of crashing.Let’s create a simple calculator that does only division:\n",

    "194   Chapter 10\n",
    "This program prompts the user to input a first_number 1 and, if the user does not enter q to quit, a second_number 2. We then divide these two numbers to get an answer 3. This program does nothing to handle errors, so asking it to divide by zero causes it to crash:\n",

It’s a good habit to keep comments up to date when you’re modifying a program, so the comment has also been changed to a docstring and reworded slightly 1.Now we can write a short loop to count the words in any text we want to analyze. We do this by storing the names of the files we want to analyze in a list, and then we call count_words() for each file in the list. We’ll try to count the words for Alice in Wonderland, Siddhartha, Moby Dick, and Little Women,  which are all available in the public domain.

We prevent our users from seeing a traceback, and we let the program continue analyzing the texts it’s able to find.

    "Siddhartha. It would never analyze Moby Dick or Little Women.\n",
    "Failing Silently\n",
    "In the previous example, we informed our users that one of the files was unavailable. But you don’t need to report every exception you catch. Sometimes, you’ll want the program to fail silently when an exception occurs and continue on as if nothing happened. To make a program fail silently, you write a try block as usual, but you explicitly tell Python to do \n",

    "    except FileNotFoundError:        pass    else:        --snip--\n",
    "The only difference between this listing and the previous one is the pass statement in the except block. Now when a FileNotFoundError is raised, the code in the except block runs, but nothing happens. No traceback is pro-duced, and there’s no output in response to the error that was raised. Users see the word counts for each file that exists, but they don’t see any indica-tion that a file wasn’t found:\n",
    "The file alice.txt has about 29594 words.The file moby_dick.txt has about 215864 words.The file little_women.txt has about 189142 words.\n",
    "The pass statement also acts as a placeholder. It’s a reminder that you’re choosing to do nothing at a specific point in your program’s execu-tion and that you might want to do something there later. For example, in this program we might decide to write any missing filenames to a file called missing_files.txt. Our users wouldn’t see this file, but we’d be able to read the file and deal with any missing texts.\n",
    "Deciding Which Errors to Report\n",
    "How do you know when to report an error to your users and when to let your program fail silently? If users know which texts are supposed to be analyzed, they might appreciate a message informing them why some texts were not analyzed. If users expect to see some results but don’t know which books are supposed to be analyzed, they might not need to know that some texts were unavailable. Giving users information they aren’t looking for can decrease the usability of your program. Python’s error-handling struc-tures give you fine-grained control over how much to share with users when things go wrong; it’s up to you to decide how much information to share.Well-written, properly tested code is not very prone to internal errors, such as syntax or logical errors. But every time your program depends on something external such as user input, the existence of a file, or the avail-ability of a network connection, there is a possibility of an exception being raised. A little experience will help you know where to include exception-handling blocks in your program and how much to report to users about errors that arise.\n",

Whatever the focus of your program is, you’ll store the information users provide in data structures such as lists and dictionaries. When users close a program, you’ll almost always want to save the information they entered. A simple way to do this involves storing your data using the json module.The json module allows you to convert simple Python data structures into JSON-formatted strings, and then load the data from that file the next time the program runs. You can also use json to share data between differ-ent Python programs. Even better, the JSON data format is not specific to Python, so you can share data you store in the JSON format with people who work in many other programming languages. It’s a useful and portable format, and it’s easy to learn.\n",

It’s customary to use the file extension .json to indicate that the data in the file is stored in the JSON format. Next, we use the json.dumps() 2 function to generate a string containing the JSON representation of the data we’re working with. Once we have this string, we write it to the file using the same write_text() method we used earlier.This program has no output, but let’s open the file numbers.json and look at it.

We then pass the contents of the file to json.loads() 3. This func-tion takes in a JSON-formatted string and returns a Python object (in this case, a list), which we assign to numbers. Finally, we print the recovered list of numbers and see that it’s the same list created in number_writer.py:\n",

    "Saving and Reading User-Generated Data\n",
    "Saving data with json is useful when you’re working with user-generated data, because if you don’t store your user’s information somehow, you’ll lose it when the program stops running. Let’s look at an example where we prompt the user for their name the first time they run a program and then remember their name when they run the program again.Let’s start by storing the user’s name:\n",

    "We need to combine these two programs into one file. When someone runs remember_me.py, we want to retrieve their username from memory if possible; if not, we’ll prompt for a username and store it in username.json for next time.

    "Often, you’ll come to a point where your code will work, but you’ll recognize that you could improve the code by breaking it up into a series of functions that have specific jobs. This process is called refactoring. Refactoring makes your code cleaner, easier to understand, and easier to extend.We can refactor remember_me.py by moving the bulk of its logic into one or more functions.

This is good practice: a function should either return the value you’re expecting, or it should return None. This allows us to perform a simple test with the return value of the func-tion. We print a welcome back message to the user if the attempt to retrieve a username is successful 3, and if it isn’t, we prompt for a new username.We should factor one more block of code out of greet_user(). If the user-name doesn’t exist, we should move the code that prompts for a new username to a function dedicated to that purpose:\n",

    "Because we’re using a function now, we rewrite the comments as a doc-string that reflects how the program currently works 1. This file is a little cleaner, but the function greet_user() is doing more than just greeting the user—it’s also retrieving a stored username if one exists and prompting for a new username if one doesn’t.Let’s refactor greet_user() so it’s not doing so many different tasks. We’ll start by moving the code for retrieving a stored username to a separate function:\n",

If the path that’s passed to get_stored_username() doesn’t exist, the function returns None 2. This is good practice: a function should either return the value you’re expecting, or it should return None. This allows us to perform a simple test with the return value of the func-tion. We print a welcome back message to the user if the attempt to retrieve a username is successful 3, and if it isn’t, we prompt for a new username.We should factor one more block of code out of greet_user(). If the user-name doesn’t exist, we should move the code that prompts for a new username to a function dedicated to that purpose:\n",
